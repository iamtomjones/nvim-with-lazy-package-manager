# My nvim config setup guide

## Install nvim

You'll firstly need to install neovim onto your computer. Full instructions on the various ways to do that can be found [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md). But I use a mac and install with homebrew.

```bash
brew install nvim
```

## Clone this repo

Next you will clone this repo onto your machine by running the following command.

```
git clone git@github.com:iamtomjones/nvim-with-lazy-package-manager.git ~/.config/nvim/
```

## Lazyvim package manager

This config is using lazyvim as the package manager and follows the [structured setup](https://lazy.folke.io/installation).

## Get started

Open neovim in your terminal and Lazyvim will install the plugins I like to use.

## Plugins

For information on the plugins being used, visit the github repos for each of them to find the documentation.
